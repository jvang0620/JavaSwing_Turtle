# Java Swing Turtle Project

## Description

This is one of my first Java projects, where I explored basic object-oriented programming, GUI development, and image manipulation. The project utilizes turtle graphics for simple drawings, inspired by the LOGO programming language, and introduces image processing through various classes that extend core Java functionalities.

Initially, I was hesitant to include this project in my portfolio due to its simplicity, but I decided to keep it as a testament to my growth as a programmer. It showcases my early experiences with Java and serves as a benchmark for how far I have come since then.

## Key Features

- **Turtle Graphics**: Uses a `Turtle` and `World` class to create graphical drawings.
- **Picture Manipulation**: Includes classes like `Picture` and `PictureFrame` to handle advanced image processing, display, and manipulation.
- **GUI Development**: Demonstrates the use of Java Swing components for creating graphical interfaces to display images.

## Project Highlights

- **Basic Object-Oriented Programming**: Implemented core OOP principles such as inheritance and polymorphism.
- **Java Swing GUI**: Developed a basic graphical interface for image display and manipulation.
- **Image Manipulation**: Supported operations such as copying images, setting dimensions, and creating new pictures from existing files or `BufferedImage` objects.

This project showcases my initial efforts with Java programming and serves as a foundation for my later work with more complex projects.
